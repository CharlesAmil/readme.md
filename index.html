                <p> Tricycles are built in a variety of styles, which differ from city to city, and are usually made

                    sidecar are covered, but not always by the same roof. Larger companies, such as Fitcor Marketing,
                    also manufacture passenger tricycles.[2] They are built with more seats, with the motor situated at
                    the back rather than below the driver as per a motorcycle. </p>

                <h2>Spanish Colonial Era</h2>
                <p> Like many cities in the Philippines, Dumaguete has a rich history dating back to the Spanish
                    colonial period. The city was founded in the 18th century and became an important center of trade
                    and commerce under Spanish rule. During this time, Dumaguete was part of the Spanish East Indies and
                    played a significant role in the region's economy and administration. </p>

                <h2>American Occupation</h2>
                <p>Dumaguete, like the rest of the Philippines, came under American control after the Spanish-American
                    War in 1898. The Americans established civil governance in the country, introducing educational and
                    infrastructural reforms. Dumaguete saw the establishment of schools, roads, and other modern
                    amenities during this period, shaping its development in the early 20th century.</p>

                <h2>World War II</h2>
                <p> During World War II, Dumaguete, like many parts of the Philippines, experienced the Japanese
                    occupation. The city was occupied by Japanese forces, and residents endured hardships during this
                    time. The local population also contributed to the resistance movement against the Japanese
                    occupation, with acts of guerrilla warfare and sabotage occurring in the region. The war left
                    lasting scars on Dumaguete's landscape and community, but it also demonstrated the resilience and
                    bravery of its people.</p>
